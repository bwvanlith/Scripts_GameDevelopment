## About The Project

This repo is meant as a place to dump useful scripts usefull for game development and other projects. Some items have been used only a few times and might have been lacking at the time. Documentation has been part of the development process and is gone. In my spare time I will:

* Uploade new scripts, test them, fix issues and add some basic functionality.
* Add documentation to explain what they do :smile:
* See if I have any time to work on requests.

Of course, you may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Getting Started

Have a look in each seperate folder for a subsequent README. If anything is missing or unclear, just drop me a line or add an issue.

### Prerequisites

All prerequisites and dependencies will be listed in the documentation per script.
